# Jabber
This is a Jabber client for Firefox OS. You can connect to every jabber server with it (this means you can also use Facebook Chat within this client).

## Run
* Install it in the Firefox OS Simulator
* Run it in your browser (index.html)

## Development

### Get all dependencies
`npm install`

### Serving webpage
If you want to run the app from localhost, you can start a local server with

`gulp serve`

But running it from file:// should currently work too.

### Running jslint to minimize code errors
Please use

`gulp jslint`

before checking in any files.

### TODOs
Currently there is no minifier configured yet. This will come later.

If you'd like to help out with this, feel free to fork this repo and create a Pull Request. We'll look into it as soon as possible.
